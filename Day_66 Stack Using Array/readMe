STACK USING ARRAY :
A stack data structure can be implemented using a one-dimensional array. 
But stack implemented using array stores only a fixed number of data values. 
This implementation is very simple. Just define a one dimensional array of specific size and insert or delete the values into that array by using LIFO principle with the help of a variable called 'top'. 
Initially, the top is set to -1. 
Whenever we want to insert a value into the stack, increment the top value by one and then insert. 
Whenever we want to delete a value from the stack, then delete the top value and decrement the top value by one.

OPERATION	   BEST TIME COMPLEXITY	   WORST TIME COMPLEXITY	   AVERAGE TIME COMPLEXITY	  SPACE COMPLEXITY
Push	         O(1)	                   O(N)	                    O(1)	                         O(1)
Pop	           O(1)	                   O(1)	                    O(1)	                         O(1)
Peek	         O(1)	                   O(1)	                    O(1)	                         O(1)
