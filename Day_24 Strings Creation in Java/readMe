STRING :
String in java is a object that represents the sequence of characters kind of word or sentence.

String is a class in Java available in java.lang package create and manipulate the String objects,So we can say that String is a reference type not a primitive type.

We can create a String as a "literal" which is known as intern string or we can create by using "new" keyword as an "Object".

Here I have implemented both the types.

By going through String literals,it returns the string value in string pool which is present in Heap Memory.
By going through new keyword, it always create a new object in Heap Memory.
