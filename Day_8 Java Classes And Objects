// Java Program for creating Classes and objects
class A
{
   void printing()
   {
    System.out.println("Class A Method is executing");
   }
}
public class JavaClassAndObject {
    public static void main(String [] args)
    {
        A ob=new A();
        ob.printing();
    }
}

PROBLEM :
Defining a class and create object for the class and then call the methods of that class

HOW I SOLVED THIS :
Here I have used the keyword "class" to create a class named "A".Then I have declared a method i.e., printing() which will print some text.
Then in the Main method class I have created the object "ob" for the class A.
Then I have called the printing() method with that object of class A.

POSSIBLE TEST CASES :
1)OUTPUT :
Class A method is executing

2)If the method or the class is not declared properly,then it will show error!
