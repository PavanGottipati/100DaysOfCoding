PROBLEM :
Write a java program to find the given string is palindrome string or not.

HOW I IMPLEMENTED THIS?
Here first take the input String.
Then read one empty string variable.
Then in the input String,take one letter by using charAt() dunction which is a member of String class.
Then store that letter in one character variable and append them in front of the new empty string.
Do the process upto the last element.

TEST CASE 1:
  INPUT :
    Enter a string in small letters
    divid
  OUTPUT :
    The String is Palindrome
    
    
TEST CASE 2:
  INPUT :
    Enter a string in small letters
    pavan
  OUTPUT :
    The String is not a Palindrome.
    
TEST CASE 3:
  INPUT :
    Enter a string in small letters
    DIVID
  OUTPUT :
    The string is not a Palindrome.
