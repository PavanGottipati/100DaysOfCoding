PROBLEM :
Write a java program to calculate overtime pay of N employees.
Overtime pay is paid at the rate of Rs. 12.00 per hour for every hour worked above 40 hours.
Assume that employees do not work for fractional part of an hour.

HOW I IMPLEMENTED THIS ?
Here we need to calculate overtime pay for more than one employee in an organization.
So I have used single dimensional arrays to solve his problem.
Then read the working hours of each employee into an array.
Then check whose working hours are more than 40 hours.
For thenm, find the extra hours more than 40 hours to each individually and multiply the extra hours with 12.00 , then store them in another array.
Then we find the overtime pay of employee who works more than 40 hours.

TEST CASE 1:
  INPUT :
    Enter number of employees
    5
    Working hours of user 1
    27
    Working hours of user 2
    35
    Working hours of user 3
    47
    Working hours of user 4
    42
    Working hours of user 5
    19
  OUTPUT :
    Employee 3 get overtime pay of rupees 84
    Employee 4 get overtime pay of rupees 24
    
TEST CASE 2:
  INPUT :
    Enter number of employees
    3
    Working hours of user 1
    38
    Working hours of user 2
    46
    Working hours of user 3
    52
  OUTPUT :
    Employee 2 get overtime pay of rupees 72
    Employee 3 get overtime pay of rupees 144
    
TEST CASE 3 :
  INPUT :
    Enter number of employees
    5
    Working hours of user 1
    34
    Working hours of user 2
    32
    Working hours of user 3
    39
    Working hours of user 4
    16
    Working hours of user 5
    25
  OUTPUT :
             //There is no output. Because one employee worked for more than 40 hours
