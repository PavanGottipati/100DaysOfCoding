PROBLEM :
Sort the list of n elements using Max Heap

HEAP SORT :
Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure. 
It is similar to the selection sort where we first find the minimum element and place the minimum element at the beginning. 
Repeat the same process for the remaining elements.

MAX HEAP :
A max-heap is a complete binary tree in which the value in each internal node is greater than or equal to the values in the children of that node. 
Mapping the elements of a heap into an array is trivial: if a node is stored an index k, then its left child is stored at index 2k + 1 and its right child at index 2k + 2.

TEST CASE 1 :
Enter array size
5
Enter elements into array
32
1
5
4
8
Before sorting.....
[32, 1, 5, 4, 8]
Sorted array using Max Heap is
[1, 4, 5, 8, 32]

TEST CASE 2 :
Enter array size
6
Enter elements into array
4
1
2
6
5
8
Before sorting.....
[4, 1, 2, 6, 5, 8]
Sorted array using Max Heap is
[1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8]

TEST CASE 3 :
Enter array size
3
Enter elements into array
5
5
5
Before sorting.....
[5, 5, 5]
Sorted array using Max Heap is
[5, 5, 5]

TEST CASE 4 :
Enter array size
0
Enter elements into array
Before sorting.....
[]
Sorted array using Max Heap is
[]
