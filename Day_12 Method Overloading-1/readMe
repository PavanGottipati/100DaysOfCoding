METHOD OVERLOADING :
"If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters, it is known as Method Overloading."

If we have to perform only one operation, having same name of the methods increases the readability of the program.
Method Overloading is a concept of Polymorphism

PROBLEM :
Write overloaded methods named nextValue().If  the  input  is  numeric  value  of  the  type  int,  float,  or  double,  the  associated  methods  should 
return a value that is onegreater than the input parameter but with the data type similar to the input. 
If the input  is a single character either a char or a String, the associated methods should return  a  char  or  a  String  whose  value  is
the  character  immediately  following  the  input parameter. 
For  example,  nextValue(‘q’)  must  return  ‘r’.  If  the  input  is  a  String  with more  than one characters,
the method should return a new  String whose  content  is the same as the input  but the last position is the  character 
immediately following the character in the last  position of the original String. For example, nextValue(“ABC”) must return “ABD”.
If the input is null, the method returns null.

HOW I SOLVED THIS :
Here I have defined a method nextValue() method of multiple forms and with different prototype.

POSSIBLE TEST CASES :
TESTCASE 1:
INPUT :
 pavan
 10
 6.9f
 10.11
 j
 and a void method
OUTPUT :
 pavao
 11
 7.9
 11.11
 k
 null
 
TESTCASE2:
 INPUT :
   8.9f
   t
   rajesh
   93.24
   13
   and a void method
 OUTPUT :
   9.9
   u
   rajesi
   94.24
   14
   null
