PROBLEM :
Write a Java program to convert astring from Lower to Upper case and Vice Versa.

HOW I IMPLEMENTED THIS?
Here first take the input.
Then In Java,String is a in-built class which is present in java.lang package.
And that String class has many in-built functions which are used for String handling Operations.
Then, toUpperCase() is a member function of String class which converts the lowercase string to higher case.
This method returns the Uppercase of the String.
And also, toLowerCase() is also a member of String class which converts the highercase string to lower case.
This method returns the Lowercase of the String.

TEST CASE 1:
   Enter a String to convert into Upper Case
   I/P  RAVI KUMAR
   O/P  RAVI KUMAR
   
   Enter a String to convert into Lower Case
   I/P  ravi kumar
   O/P  ravi kumar

TEST CASE 2:
   Enter a String to convert into Upper Case
   I/P RAVI KUMAR
   O/P RAVI KUMAR
   Enter a String to convert into Lower Case
   I/P ravi kumar
   O/P ravi kumar

TEST CASE 3:
   Enter a String to convert into Upper Case
   I/P                                        //Null string

   Enter a String to convert into Lower Case
   O/P                                        //No Output
