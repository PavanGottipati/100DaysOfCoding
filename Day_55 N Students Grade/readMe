PROBLEM :
Write a program to calculate the total marks and find average and grades of N students.

HOW I IMPLEMENTED THIS ?
Here the problem seemd to be very easy. I have implemented this logic by using single dimensiobal arrays.
Once you can go through the code and execute it.
You can see the output in different style/format.
For those styles, I have used java printf() and String, Number formatting.

INPUT :
Enter number of students:
3
Enter student 1 details:
Roll No: 192012
Roll Name: Pavan
Subject 1 Marks: 98
Subject 2 Marks: 78
Subject 3 Marks: 88
Enter student 2 details:
Roll No: 890216
Roll Name: Rajesh
Subject 1 Marks: 25
Subject 2 Marks: 21
Subject 3 Marks: 25
Enter student 3 details:
Roll No: 374635
Roll Name: Lokesh
Subject 1 Marks: 76
Subject 2 Marks: 68
Subject 3 Marks: 78


OUTPUT :
*****************************************************************
Roll No        Name           Total          Average        Grade
*****************************************************************
192012         Pavan          264.000000     88.000000      A
