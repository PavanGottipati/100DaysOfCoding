PROBLEM :
Find the sum of all elements in the array

HOW I IMPLEMENTED THIS ?
First read the array size and then enter elements into array.
Call a function sumArray() for bfinding the sum.
Then in the function, initialize sum=0.Then run a loop from 0 to n-1 and for every iteration add the element with sum and initialize the value in sum.
After loop termination, we will get the sum of all elements in the array.

TEST CASE 1:
  INPUT :
    Enter array size
    5
    Enter elements into array
    3
    1
    7
    9
    4
  OUTPUT :
    The sum of elements in array is 24


TEST CASE 2:
  INPUT :
    Enter array size
    5
    Enter elements into array
    0
    0
    0
    0
    0
  OUTPUT :
    The sum of elements in array is 0
    
    
TEST CASE 3 :
  INPUT :
    Enter array size
    0
    Enter elements into array
  OUTPUT :
    The sum of elements in array is 0
