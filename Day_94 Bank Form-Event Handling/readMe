Here, By using Java Swings package, i have created the required objects like frame, text fiels, buttons, radio buttons, scroll pane etc.
Then I have registered the buttons with ActionListener and also the frame objects implements the ActionListener interface.
Then if the all details required in Bank registration form are filled, then after clicking submit button, then those are set to one Text Field with correponding text label.
Then if reset button is pressed, the entered information is cleared and again new form is generated.

Event and Listener (Java Event Handling) :
==>Changing the state of an object is known as an event. 
==>For example, click on button, dragging mouse etc. 
==>The java.awt.event package provides many event classes and Listener interfaces for event handling.
