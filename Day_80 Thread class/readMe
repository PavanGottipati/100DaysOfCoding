THREAD IN JAVA :
A thread in Java is the direction or path that is taken while a program is being executed. 
Generally, all the programs have at least one thread, known as the main thread, that is provided by the JVM or Java Virtual Machine at the starting of the program's execution.

A Thread can be created by using Extending the Thread class or By implementing the Runnable interface.
These are the predefined abstract Class and Interface in java.lang package

run() is member of Thread class in which the actual logic is implemented and start() is also a member of Thread class and which enables to execute the run() method

In this program, we are just going to display square of first ten natural numbers by using Thread

TEST CASE :
Thread is running
1*1=1
2*2=4
3*3=9
4*4=16
5*5=25
6*6=36
7*7=49
8*8=64
9*9=81
10*10=100
