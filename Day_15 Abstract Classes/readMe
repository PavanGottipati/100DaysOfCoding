ABSTRACTION :
Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.

ABSTRACT CLASS IN JAVA :
A class which is declared with the abstract keyword is known as an abstract class in java.
It can have abstract methods and non-abstract methods(method with the body)
In java ,"Abstraction" is achieved through "abstract" keyword.

PROBLEM :
Find the given input number is Armstrong number or not

ARMSTRONG NUMBER :
Armstrong number is the number which itself is equal to "Sum of the Cubes of the Individual Digits in it".

EXAMPLE :
153 = (1)^3 + (5)^3 +(3)^3

HOW I IMPLEMENTED THIS?
Here I have used java Abstraction concept to implement this logic.
At first I have declared one abstract class "Armstrong".In that class It must have declaration of method definition.So I have declared two methods "input()" and 
"operation()" with abstract keyword.
And I have declared one subclass names "CheckArmstrong" which inherits the "Abstrong" and in that subclass,I have implemented the logics of two methods.

TEST CASES :
Input 1:
 153
Output 1:
 153 is an Armstrong Number
 
Input 2:
 -153
Output 2:
 -153 is not an Armstrong Number
 
Input 3:
 pavan
Output 3:
 Error.....!Input must be integer type only.
