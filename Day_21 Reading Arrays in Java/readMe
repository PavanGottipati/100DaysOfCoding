ARRAYS IN JAVA :
An array is a collection of elements that are ordered,fixed size and stores unique elements.

PROBLEM ;
Read elements into array and display them.

HOW I SOLVED THIS :
First take array size and declare an array 'a' and initialize the size.
Then read elements into array in the data type in which the array is declared.
After insertion,Display the results.

TEST CASES :
  INPUT 1
    Array size 5
    Array type int
    3
    7
    2
    9
    7
  OUTPUT 1
    After insertion,the elements in the array are
     3
     7
     2
     9
     7
     
   INPUT 2
     Array size 5
     Array type int
     4
     8
     2
     9
     p
   OUTPUT 2
     Error... It is an integer type array.It can store integer values only.
