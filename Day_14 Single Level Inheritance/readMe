INHERITANCE:
Inheritance is a mechanism wherein a new class is derived from an existing class. 
In Java, classes may inherit or acquire the properties and methods of other classes. 
A class derived from another class is called a subclass, 
whereas the class from which a subclass is derived is called a superclass.

SINGLE LEVEL INHERITANCE:
Single inheritance can be defined as a derived class to inherit the basic methods (data members and variables) and behavior from a superclass.
Itâ€™s a basic is-a relationship concept exists here. 
Basically, java only uses a single inheritance as a subclass cannot extend more superclass.

PROBLEM:
To find the area if a Rectangle.

HOW I SOLVED THIS:
Here I have used Single Level Inheritance concept to implement area of Rectangle
At first class Shape consists of two integer type data members which are length and breadth and this is also a Super or Parent class.
Then another class Rectangle is a Subclass consists of one data member and one function.Data Member is area to store integer value and a function CalculateArea()

TEST CASES:
INPUT 1
 length=10
 breadth=20
OUTPUT 2
 Area of Rectangle is 300
 
INPUT 2
 length=15.7
 breadth=20.4
OUTPUT 2:
 Error.Because The input is floating value.The instance variable can store integer values only.
