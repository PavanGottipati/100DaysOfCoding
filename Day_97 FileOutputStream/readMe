FileOutputStream :
FileOutputStream is an outputstream for writing data/streams of raw bytes to file or storing data to file. 
FileOutputStream is a subclass of OutputStream. To write primitive values into a file, we use FileOutputStream class. 
For writing byte-oriented and character-oriented data, we can use FileOutputStream but for writing character-oriented data, FileWriter is more preferred.

Test Case :
In the program, we have initialized a String and stored them into byte array by using getBytes() method.
After that, by using OutputStream class, FileOutputStream class i have created three objects f0, f1 and f2 and opened three files file1, file2 and file3.
After that, I have written some contents from byte array into the three files by using write().
After that, I have closed the file by using close().

Contents in file1 :
Nwi h iefralgo e
t oet h i ftercuty n a hi u ae.

Contents in file2 :
Now is the time for all good men
 to come to the aid of their country
 and pay their due taxes.
 
 Contents in file3 :
 nd pay their due taxes.
