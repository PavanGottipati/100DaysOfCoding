PROBLEM :
Delete the Occurrences of a word "the" in a String line and display the results.

HOW I IMPLEMENTED THIS :
Here at first,I have taken input of a line.
Then I have used split(" ") function to split the given line based on space.This split("") is member of String class.
Then I have stored these words in an String array.
Then for every word in the array,I have written a function equals("the") to check the word is equal to "the".
If yes,in this place I am updating it as {""} where it effects in the array.Because Strings are immutable in Java.
Then I displayed the elements in the array.
In the result,the string is displayed without "the" word.

TEST CASE 1:
 INPUT 1:
  Enter a line
  The development and support sentences act as the body of the paragraph.
 OUTPUT 1:
  The development and support sentences act as  body of  paragraph.           // 'the' is eliminated. 
  
TEST CASE 2:
 INPUT 2:
        //null string
 OUTPUT 2:
         //no output
