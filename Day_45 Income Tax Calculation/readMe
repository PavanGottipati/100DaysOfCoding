PROBLEM :
Income (G.)            Tax Rate (%)
1-100000                   0
100001-500000              10
500001-1000000             20
1000001-4000000            30
above 4000000              37

According to the table, if a person's income is 550000 G., there is no tax for the first 100000 G., 10% of the income in the range 100001-500000 are taxed,
which equals 40,000 G., The last 50000 G. is taxed with the rate of 20% resulting 10000 G. Therefore, the total tax for this person is 60000 G.
