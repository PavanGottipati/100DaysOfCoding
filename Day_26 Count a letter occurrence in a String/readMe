PROBLEM :
Find or Count the number of occurrences of a letter in a given String link.

HOW I IMPLEMENTED THIS?
Here I have first take an input a string
Then I have used split(" ") function with space as a parameter to split each word in a string seperately.
After seperation, the words are stored in the String array.
Then for every word element in the String array, I have used contains("letter") to check whether "e" is there in the word or not.
If contains("e") returns true,then count is incremented by 1.
Otherwise,there is no increment in count value.
At final, count contains the number that "e" is there in the string.

TEST CASE 1:
 INPUT 1:
  Enter a String line
  Hello people.Do you know one thing,England won the match.
 OUTPUT 1:
  The no of occurances is 4
  
TEST CASE 2:
 INPUT 2:
  Enter a String line
                             //no input is given
 OUTPUT 2:
  The no of occurrences is 0
  
TEST CASE 3:
 INPUT 3:
  Enter a string line
  " "                         //One one space is given as input
 
 OUTPUT 3:
  The no of occurences is 0
