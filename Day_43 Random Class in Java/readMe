PROBLEM :
Write a Java program that randomly picks an English alphabet (A-Z) and keeps asking the user to guess the alphabet until he/she has got it right.
Also report the number of trials.

HOW I IMPLEMENTED THIS ?
Here I have implemented this scenario by using Random class in Java.

Random class in Java :
Random class is a member of java.util package.
Random class is used to generate pseudo-random numbers in java. An instance of this class is thread-safe. 
The instance of this class is however cryptographically insecure. This class provides various method calls to generate different random data types such as float, double, int.

Constructors:
Random(): Creates a new random number generator
Random(long seed): Creates a new random number generator using a single long seed

For Random class, first we have to create an object and call the nextInt(int x) by passing integer x as a parameter,
then it will generate a random number within the range.

Then, the generated random value is compared with the user input.If it matches, the execution terminated.If not ,it resume the flow.
