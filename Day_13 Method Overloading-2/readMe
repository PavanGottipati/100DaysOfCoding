METHOD OVERLOADING :
"If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters, it is known as Method Overloading."

If we have to perform only one operation, having same name of the methods increases the readability of the program.
Method Overloading is a concept of Polymorphism

PROBLEM :
Create a function called display and display all the details of Employee,Student and Department

HOW I SOLVED THIS :
Here I have used Method Overloading concept, and based on the person,I have differentiated those methods with the number of parameters.
