MULTIPLE INHERITANCE :
Multiple inheritance in java is the capability of creating a single class with multiple superclasses.
Unlike some other popular object oriented programming languages like C++, java doesn't provide support for multiple inheritance in classes.
We can implement multiple inheritance in java through interface concept.
In multiple inheritance, One class inherit the properties of two classes at the same time.

PROBLEM :
The price of the Harddisk is RS 3500/-.The customer wants to purchase n number of Harddisks.Then write a java program to calculate the total bill which has to be paid 
by the customer and display the details.

HOW I IMPLEMENTED THIS?
Here I have used Multiple Inheritance concept and in that I have included Interface concept to implement the logic and to get more security for the data.
At first I have created a class Customer and included customer details in it.
An interface "Item" and in that I have included item name and declaration of one method "bill()".
Then I have created one class "Sales" and it inherits Customer class and Item interface at the same time.
Then I have implemented the logic of bill() in tha Sales class.
That bill() calculates the total bill amount (number of products * price)

TEST CASE
*********
INPUT
 cname Pavan
 phno 894398
 noItems 5
OUTPUT
 The Billing details are
 Pavan 894398 Harddisk 17500.0
