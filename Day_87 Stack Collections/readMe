Stack in Collections :

Java Collection framework provides a Stack class that models and implements a Stack data structure. The class is based on the basic principle of last-in-first-out. 
In addition to the basic push and pop operations, the class provides three more functions of empty and peek. 
The class can also be said to extend Vector and treats the class as a stack with the four mentioned functions. 
The class can also be referred to as the subclass of Vector.
