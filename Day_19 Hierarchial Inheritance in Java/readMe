HIERARCHIAL INHERITANCE :
We already know that "Hierarchical inheritance" occurs when multiple child classes inherit the methods and properties of the same parent class.
This simply means we have only one superclass and multiple sub-classes in hierarchical inheritance in Java.

PROBLEM :
Initialise the values to the Account holder and withdraw somw money from Savings account and calculate the rate of interest on amount in Fixed account.
And display the results.

HOW I IMPLEMENTED THIS :
Here I have used Java Hierarchial Inheritance concept to implement the logic.
At first I have created one class "Account" and it contains account number and name of the account holder.And this is the Super class.
Then I have created one another class "Savings" which inherits the "Account" class.It has one method "withdraw()" to debit money from the customer account.
And also I have created one another class "Fixed" inherits the "Account" class and it has one method "interest()" to calculate the interest on money in Fixed Account.

TEST CASE
 INPUT 
   Enter account number 298327
   Enter account holder number Pavan
   Enter the balance in Savings Account 5000
   Enter the amount in Fixed Account 7000
 OUTPUT
   Enter the amount to be withdrawn 1000
   
   After withdrawn, the account details are
   -------------------------------------------
   298327 Pavan 4000.0
   -------------------------------------------
   
   
   The interest on 7000.0 is 840.0
   The account details after adding interset about 6 rate of interest for 2 years of time is
   -----------------------------------
   298327 Pavan 7840.0
   -----------------------------------
