PROBLEM :
Count the number of occurrences of vowels ina line and display the results.

HOW I IMPLEMENTED THIS :
Here at first,take one input in the form of String.
take ecount initial value as 0.
Then take each and every letter in a string and compare with the vowels ('a','e','i','o','u','A','E','I','O','U')
If they are equal,then increment the count by 1.
Otherwise skip the incrementation and move to next character.
Hence if we reach the last element,we check the condition and increment the count by one and break from the loop.

TEST CASE 1:
 INPUT :
   Enter a line
   Hello all how are you people
 OUTPUT :
   The number of vowels present in the line are 11
   
TEST CASE 2:
 INPUT :
   Enter a line
                  //no input or empty
 OUTPUT :
   The number of vowels present in the line are 0
