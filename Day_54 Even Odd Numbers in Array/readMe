PROBLEM :
Display the even numbers and Odd numbers in an Array

HOW I IMPLEMENTED THIS ?
Here take elements into array
Then traverse the elements in array loop1, if the element in array is divided by 2, then display the number as Even.
After that run loop to traverse the elements in array, if the element is not divided by 2, then display the number as Odd.

TEST CASE 1 :
  INPUT :
    Enter array size
    5
    Enter elements into array
    2  1  6  4  5
  OUTPUT :
    The Even elements are
    2  6  4
    The Odd elements are
    1  5
    
TEST CASE 2 :
  INPUT :
    Enter array size
    5
    Enter elements into array
    2  4  6  4  8
  OUTPUT :
    The Even elements are
    2  4  6  4  8
    The Odd elements are
                //No odd elements
                
TEST CASE 3 :
  INPUT :
    Enter array size
    3
    Enter elements into array
    3  1  7
  OUTPUT :
    The Even elements are

    The Odd elements are
    3  1  7

TEST CASE 4 :
  INPUT :
    Enter array size
    0
    Enter elements into array

  OUTPUT :
    The Even elements are

    The Odd elements are
