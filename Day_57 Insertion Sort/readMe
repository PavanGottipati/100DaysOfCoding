PROBLEM :
Sort the elements in ascending order using the algorithm in which you use in playing cards.

HOW I IMPLEMENTED THIS ?
Here, the algorithm that we use for shuffling of playing cards is "Insertion Sort"
So, I have solved this problem by using insertion sort.

INSERTION SORT :
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands.
The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. 
Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.

PSEUDOCODE FOR INSERTION SORT :
INSERTION(A)
1)for j<- 2 to n
2)   do key<- A[j]
3)      i<- j-1
4)      whilei>0 and A[i]>key
5)        do A[i+1]<- A[i]
6)           i<- i-1
7)      A[i+1}<-key
8)End

TIME COMPLEXITY OF INSERTION SORT :
BEST CASE : O(n)
AVERAGE CASE : O(n^2)
WORST CASE : O(n^2)

WORST SPACE COMPLEXITY : O(1)

TEST CASE 1 :
INPUT :
Enter array size
5
Enter elements into array
3  1  9  7  3
Insertion sort successful
1 3 3 7 9

TEST CASE 2 :
INPUT :
Enter array size
5
Enter elements into array
1  2  3  4  5
OUTPUT :
Insertion sort successful
1 2 3 4 5

TEST CASE 3 :
INPUT :
Enter array size
5
Enter elements into array
5  4  3  2  1
OUTPUT :
Insertion sort successful
1 2 3 4 5
