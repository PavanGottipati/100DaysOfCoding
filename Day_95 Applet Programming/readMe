Applets in Java :
...............................................
An applet is a Java program that can be embedded into a web page. 
It runs inside the web browser and works at client side. 
An applet is embedded in an HTML page using the APPLET or OBJECT tag and hosted on a web server. 
Applets are used to make the website more dynamic and entertaining.

There are two types of Applets... they are 1)Local applet (within system) and 2)Remote applet (From another system)

There is no main method in Java applet code. Only paint method is present.
There is no print method, instead of it we use drawString method to print or write something on window.
