EXCEPTION IN JAVA :
An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program, that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. 
When an error occurs within a method, the method creates an object and hands it off to the runtime system.

MULTIPLE CATCH BLOCK :
A try block can be followed by one or more catch blocks. Each catch block must contain a different exception handler. 
So, if you have to perform different tasks at the occurrence of different exceptions, use java multi-catch block.
All catch blocks must be ordered from most specific to most general, i.e. catch for ArithmeticException must come before catch for Exception.

TEST CASE 1 :
Enter a number for division
10
Here the array size is 5 , So enter a index from 0 to 4 to insert the result after division operation
3
Operations Done Successfully.. Without any Exceptions
Rest Of The Code.............

TEST CASE 2 :
Enter a number for division
0
Here the array size is 5 , So enter a index from 0 to 4 to insert the result after division operation
2
java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
Rest Of The Code.............

TEST CASE 3 :
Enter a number for division
10
Here the array size is 5 , So enter a index from 0 to 4 to insert the result after division operation
5
java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 5 out of bounds for length 5
