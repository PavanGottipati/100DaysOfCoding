PROBLEM :
Write a program that will read a line and count all occurences of the word 'the' in a String.

HOW I IMPLEMENTED THIS?
Here I have first read a paragraph or a line.
And in java,there is a function split("character") that takes a character in a string and for every that character,it split the string seperated by ','.
Then I have stored those splitted strings in a String array.
Then there is one function equals("word") that takes one word as a parameter, With that function I have checked that every element in the array is matched with it or not.
If yes, it will increment the count value.(At first,count is initialised with zero).
If not, proceed for the next element in the string array.
If it readched to the final element in the array,the count value is calculated.

TEST CASE 1
 INPUT :
   Enter a line
     Paragraph structure isnâ€™t just for the benefit of readers, it also helps authors organize their thoughts and communicate clearly. Below we explain the different steps of how to write a paragraph, from the paragraph introduction all the way to the conclusion.
 OUTPUT :
   The number of Occurences of "the" are 5
   
TEST CASE 2
  INPUT :
    Enter a line
    
  OUTPUT :
    The number of Occurences of "the" are 0
