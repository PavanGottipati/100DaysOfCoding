PROBLEM : Delete the Occurrences of the Vowels (a,e,i,o,u,A,E,I,O,U) in a given String and display them.

HOW I IMPLEMENTED THIS :
Here at first take the input.
Then Vowels are (a,e,i,o,u,A,E,I,O,U).
So I have used replace() function to replace the occurrence of vowel and make them "".
It Replaces each substring of this string that matches the given regular expression with the given replacement.

An invocation of this method of the form str.replaceAll(regex, repl) yields exactly the same result as the expression

replaceAll("[aeiouAEIOU]","")
then the vowels are replaced with "".

TEST CASE 1 :
 INPUT :
   Enter a Line
   Hello all.How are yoy all? Is there any problem to you
 OUTPUT :
   After deleting the vowels
   Hll ll.Hw r yy ll? s thr ny prblm t y
   
TEST CASE 2:
  INPUT :
           //no input
  OUTPUT :
    After deleting the vowels
