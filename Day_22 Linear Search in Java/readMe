LINEAR SEARCH :
A linear search is the simplest method of searching a data set. 
Starting at the beginning of the data set, each item of data is examined until a match is made.
Once the item is found, the search ends. If there is no match, the algorithm must deal with this.
If there is no match till last element,then the element is not present in the dataset.

PROBLEM :
Given an array of elements, and search the key element in the sequence.

HOW I IMPLEMENTED THIS?
Here I have implemented Linear Search Algorithm to perform the searching Operation from starting to ending in the sequence.
If the element forund in the array,then the remaining operations are skipped and it return true (Means the element present in the array).
Otherwise,it returns false (Means the element not present in the array).

TEST CASES 1:
 First check the array is declared or not.And also the elements are inserted or not.
 If there is nothing,then it throws error.
 
TEST CASE 2:
 
 Enter array size
 5
 Enter elements into array
 3 
 7
 9
 2
 6
 Enter key element to search
 9
 true

TEST CASE 3:
Enter array size
5
Enter elements into array
3
7
9
2
6
Enter key element to search
8
false
