MULTILEVEL INHERITANCE :
The multi-level inheritance includes the involvement of atleast two or more than two classes.One class inherits the features from a parent class and the newly created
sub-class becomes the base class for another class.

PROBLEM :
Find the total marks of a student and display the student details.

HOW I IMPLEMENTED THIS?
Here I have used Multilevel Inheritance concept to implement the logic.
Here the first class "Student" is a parent class and it contains two instance variables "sno" and "sname" which stores some data about student.
Then I have created another class "Test" which inherits "Student" class and contains three instance variables which stores marks of three subjects.
Then I have created another clas "Result" which inherits "Test" class.Then "Result" class can use "Student" and "Test" class properties also.

TEST CASES :
INPUT 1
 sno 192012
 sname pavan
 m1 98
 m2 89
 m3 79
 
OUTPUT 1
 Student details are
 Student Number 192012
 Student Name pavan
 Total Marks 266.00
 
INPUT 2
 sno 192012
 sname pavan
 m1 37.8
 m2 sod
 m3 98
 
OUTPUT 2
 Error...! The input is not matched with the datatype....
