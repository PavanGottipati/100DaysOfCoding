PROBLEM :
The X and Y coordinates (X,Y) of N different points are entered through the keyboard as a user input.
Write a program to find the distance oflast point from the first point (sum of distance between consecutive points).

HOW I IMPLEMENTED THIS ?
Here first take the number consecutive ponts.Then assign the number as the size of two single dimensional arrays X and Y.
Then read the elements into two arrays paralelly in which first number into X array as abscissa and next number as ordinate into Y array.
Then find the distance between the two points in two arrays with respective to each other and add the result for very iteration.

Finally, we can get the sum value of N consecutive coordinate points distance.

TEST CASE 1 :
  INPUT :
    Enter number of coornate points : 2
      Enter coordinate of X1 : 4
      Enter the coordinate of Y1 : 7
      Enter coordinate of X2 : 1
      Enter the coordinate of Y2 : 9
  OUTPUT :
      Sum is 3.605551275463989
      
TEST CASE 2 :
  INPUT :
    Enter number of coordinate points : 4
     Enter coordinate of X1 : 4
     Enter the coordinate of Y1 : 2
     Enter coordinate of X2 : 8
     Enter the coordinate of Y2 : 6
     Enter coordinate of X3 : 1
     Enter the coordinate of Y3 : 6
     Enter coordinate of X4 : 7
     Enter the coordinate of Y4 : 3
  OUTPUT :
    Sum is 19.36505818199175
