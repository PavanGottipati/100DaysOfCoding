HYBRID INHERITANCE :
Hybrid Inheritance is the combination of two or more types of Inheritances.
Again Hybrid Inheritance is implemented in Java through Interface.
class A will be acting as the Parent for class B & class C.And also class B & class C will be acting as Parent for class D.

PROBLEM :
Write a Java Program to take input from the user of Student details like number and name.Then as part of academics,take three subjects marks and find total.
And also as a part of Sports,take grade and display all the results.

HOW I IMPLEMENTED THIS :
Here I have used Java Hybrid Inheritance concept to implement the logic.
At first I have created one class "Student" and it contains two data members of student number and name.
Then I have created another class "Test" and it inherits "Student" and also it contains the marks of three subjects of student.
Then I have created one interface "Sports" and it contains the grade of a student in sports and one method "showGrade()" to display the grade.
At last I have created one class "Results" which inherits class "Test" and implements the interface "Sports" and it contains "show()" method to calculate the
total marks and display them.

TEST CASE:
  INPUT
    Enter the details of a Student
    Enter Student Roll Number
    192012
    Enter student name
    Pavan
    Enter Student marks of Three Subjects
    Enter marks in Maths
    98
    Enter marks in Computer Science
    99
    Enter marks in Statistics
    79
  OUTPUT
    The Academic Details of Student are
    -----------------------------------
    sno 192012
    sname Pavan
    Total Marks 276.0
    -----------------------------------


    The Sports Grade of a Student are
    ---------------------------------
    sno 192012
    sname Pavan
    Grade A
    ---------------------------------
