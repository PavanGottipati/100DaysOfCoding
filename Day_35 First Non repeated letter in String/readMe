PROBLEM :
Write a java program to find a first non repeating letter in the String.

HOW I IMPLEMENTED THIS ?
Read a String.Then take first letter and compare with all letters from last.
If it equals to any letter except itself at its position in the string then unique must be false.
If it not equals to the other letters in the String, then unique is true.
The loop is terminated and it print the letter.
The printed letter is the first element in the string which is not repeadted in the String.

TEST CASE 1:
  INPUT :
    Enter a String :
    pavan
  OUTPUT :
    The given string is : pavan
    The first non repeated character in String is : p
    
TEST CASE 2:
  INPUT :
    Enter a String :
    ravikumar
  OUTPUT :
    The given string is : ravikumar
    The first non repeated character in String is : i
    
TEST CASE 3:
  INPUT :
    Enter a String :
    ppbbllee
  OUTPUT :
    The given string is : ppbbllee     //In this string all letters are repeated more than one time. So no output
