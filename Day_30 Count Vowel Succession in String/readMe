PROBLEM :
Write a program to count the number of occurrences of any two vowels in succession in a line of text.
For example,in the sentence
"Please read this application and give me gratuity"
The number of vowel successions are 3
such a occurrences are ea,ea,ui

HOW I IMPLEMENTED THIS?
Here First take input and then split that input by using split(" ") function by differentiating them with space.
Then store the words in a array.
Then for every word in iteration,make the letter and next to that letter as string in tha word.
Compare that string with the vowels successions ("aa","ae","ai","ao","au","ea","ee","ei","eo","eu","ia","ie","ii","io","iu","oa","oe","oi","oo","ou","ua","ue","ui","uo","uu")
If they are equal increment count by 1.
Else,no increment in count.

After the end,count value is returned.

TEST CASE 1:
  INPUT :
    Enter a line
    hello all.how are you
  OUTPUT : 
    ou
    The no of vowel successions are 1
    
TEST CASE 2:
  INPUT :
    Enter a line
    Paragraphs are medium-sized units of writing, longer than sentences, but shorter than sections, chapters, or entire works. Because they connect the "small" ideas of individual sentences to a "bigger" idea, paragraph structure is essential to any writing for organization, flow, and comprehension.
  OUTPUT :
    iu
    io
    au
    ea
    ua
    ea
    ia
    io
    io
    The no of vowel successions are 9
    
 TEST CASE 3:
   INPUT :
     Enter a line
                 //empty String
   OUTPUT :
     The no of vowel successions are 0
