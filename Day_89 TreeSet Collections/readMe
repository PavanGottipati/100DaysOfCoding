TreeSet :
TreeSet is one of the most important implementations of the SortedSet interface in Java that uses a Tree for storage. 
The ordering of the elements is maintained by a set using their natural ordering whether or not an explicit comparator is provided. 
This must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the Set interface.

NavigableSet :
NavigableSet represents a navigable set in Java Collection Framework. The NavigableSet interface inherits from the SortedSet interface. 
It behaves like a SortedSet with the exception that we have navigation methods available in addition to the sorting mechanisms of the SortedSet.
